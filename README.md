A method to automatically develop the structure of neural network by combining genetic algorithm and neural network algorithm.

Represent the structure of neural network by a directed acyclic graph rather than multiple layer graph. In the beginning of training stage, there is no hidden neuron in the network. The hidden neuron and the connection between neurons are developed during the evolution process.

The first task is to approximate bool function whose complexity is controllable. This task can be used to test whether our method can develop appropriate network structure to solve the problem, and make the network as small as possible.

The second task is the mnist dataset which is a computer vision problem.

The third task is the cart-pole balancing problem which is a reinforcement learning problem.
