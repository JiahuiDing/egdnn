A method to automatically develop the structure of neural network by combining genetic algorithm and neural network algorithm.

Represent the structure of neural network by a directed acyclic graph rather than multiple layer
graph. In the beginning of training stage, there is no hidden neuron in the network. The
hidden neuron and the connection between neurons are developed during the evolution
process.
